# LoL-match-outcome-predictor: A Binary Classification Model for league_of_legends_data_large.csv

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the development, training, and evaluation of a binary classification model using machine learning techniques. The model was developed as part of the final project for the online course PyTorch Basics for Machine Learning. The primary objective of this project was to apply the machine learning techniques I learned throughout the course to a real-world dataset, using PyTorch to predict the outcomes of League of Legends (LoL) matches based on historical data.
